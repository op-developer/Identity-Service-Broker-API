# Service Provider API for OP Identity Service Broker

2020-10-27

OP Identification Service Broker allows Service Providers to implement strong electronic identification (Finnish bank credentials, Mobile ID) easily to websites and mobile apps via single API.

To identify the user the Service Provider (your website) redirects the user to the Identification Service Broker (OP) with an authorization request. The user chooses the Identity Provider (a bank or Mobile ID) and is redirected there where he/she authenticates with his/her own credentials. OP will process the authentication result, and return the user to your website with verified information about the identity of the user.

### Sandbox users

OP Identity Service Provider does not require registration and uses fixed credentials (Client ID & encryption keys). __See section 13__.

## 1. Definitions

- **Service Provider (SP)** is the service asking for the user identity.
- **Identity Service Broker (ISB)** is the OP service that lets the user choose an identity provider and that passes the requested user identity information to the service provider.
- **Identity Provider (IdP)** is a provider of identification, i.e. a Bank or mobile ID.
- **Identity Service Broker UI** is a list of Identity Providers shown on the UI. There are two options for displaying the UI. Service Provider can redirect the user to the hosted UI in the Identity Service Broker or embed the UI into its own UI.
- **OIDC** or OpenID Connect is a standard easy to use protocol for identifying and authenticating users.
- **JWT** or JSON Web Token is a standard for wrapping attributes into a token. JWS is a signed and JWE an encrypted JWT token.
- **JWKS** JSON Web Key Set is a standard way to exchange public keys between SP and ISB.

## 2. Prerequisites

To identify users using the Identity Service Broker and the OIDC API for Service Providers, you need the following pieces of configuration:

* Client identifier

  Your service is identified by a unique client identifier string, which OP will generate for you during the onboarding process.

* OP OIDC authorization endpoint

  The OP OIDC authorization endpoint for production use is `https://isb.op.fi/oauth/authorize`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/authorize`.

* OP OIDC token endpoint

  The OP OIDC token endpoint for production use is `https://isb.op.fi/oauth/token`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/token`.

* OP OIDC profile endpoint

  The OP OIDC profile endpoint for production use is `https://isb.op.fi/oauth/profile`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/profile`. This endpoint provides exactly the same information as the token endpoint and as such is redundant.

* RSA keypair to sign requests

   Signing is used for verifying that requests originate from the SP. Signing is used in requests to two endpoints: /oauth/authorize and /oauth/token.

To generate a 2048 bit RSA key run the command `openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048` (you could replace the filename private.pem with one of your own choosing).

* RSA keypair to decrypt identity token

  OP will encrypt the identity token identifying the user with your public key and you will have to decrypt it with your private key. Keys are generated the same way as signing keys. Both encryption and signing public keys must be published in the SP's JKWS endpoint. Keep the private portions of these keypairs private.

* OP JWKS endpoint

  Identity tokens are signed by OP to protect their content. You must verify the signature against OP's public key which can be fetched from the OP JWKS endpoint `https://isb.op.fi/jwks/broker`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb-test.op.fi/jwks/broker`. Note that the keys are rolled over at times. The endpoint may contain several valid keys. You may safely cache keys for at most one day. When fetching keys from endpoint you must verify the TLS certificate to ensure that the keys are genuine.

## 3. Security concerns

- Private RSA keys must be protected and not revealed to users.
- The keys should be rotated every now and then. When depracating a key you should remove it from your JWKS endpoint at least one day before deactivating it to prevent disruptions to service. We may cache your public keys for up to one day on the ISB.
- Keys must not be sent to the user's browser. I.e. processing the identification should be done server side, not in browser side Javascript.

## 4. Flow with hosted Identity Service Broker UI

  OP identification service uses the OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow. I.e. the following steps are taken to identify a user:

1. Service Provider directs the user to OP's service endpoint with parameters documented below. `ftn_idp_id` shall not exist among request parameters
2. OP lets the user identify themselves using a provider of their choosing.
3. Once identified, the user is passed back to the Service Provider's `redirect_uri` with an access code.
4. The Service Provider makes a direct API call to the OP API and gets an encrypted and signed identity token in exchange for the access code.

![Flow graph](./flow.png?raw=true)

## 5. Flow with embedded Identity Service Broker UI

  OP identification service uses the OpenID Connect Authorization Code flow. I.e. the following steps are taken to identify a user:

1. Service Provider uses the /api/embedded-ui/{client_id} API to get the data to display the embedded Identity Service Broker UI on the SP UI.
2. Service Provider lets the user choose identity provider.
3. Service Provider directs the user to OP's service endpoint with parameters documented below. `ftn_idp_id` shall be delivered as request parameter
4. Once identified, the user is passed back to the Service Provider's `redirect_uri` with an access code.
5. The Service Provider makes a direct API call to the OP API and gets an encrypted and signed identity token in exchange for the access code.

![Flow graph](./embedded-ui-flow.png?raw=true)

## 6. GET /api/embedded-ui/{client_id}

To display the embedded Identity Service Broker UI the Service Provider shall use the /api/embedded-ui/{client_id} API of the Identity Service Broker to get the needed data. Client_id is the client identifier that specifies which service provider is asking for identification. Service Provider does not need to use this API if it uses the flow with hosted Identity Service Broker UI.

The query string of the request can include the following optional parameter:
- **lang** indicates the language for the returned data (`fi`, `sv` or `en`). If parameter is omitted the default language is `fi`.

Example API calls:

`GET https://isb-test.op.fi/api/embedded-ui/example_service_provider`

`GET https://isb-test.op.fi/api/embedded-ui/example_service_provider?lang=en`

The API returns json data.

Example of returned data:
```json
{
  "identityProviders": [
    {
        "name": "Osuuspankki",
        "imageUrl": "https://isb-test.op.fi/public/images/idp/op_140x75.png",
        "ftn_idp_id": "fi-op"
    },
    {
        "name": "Nordea",
        "imageUrl": "https://isb-test.op.fi/public/images/idp/nordea_140x75.png",
        "ftn_idp_id": "fi-nordea"
    }
  ],
  "isbProviderInfo": "The OP Identity Service Broker is provided by OP Financial Group member cooperative banks and OP Corporate Bank plc.",
  "isbConsent": "During authentication, your personal ID and name are forwarded to the service provider.",
  "privacyNoticeText": "OP privacy notice",
  "privacyNoticeLink": "https://isb-test.op.fi/privacy-info?lang=en",
  "disturbanceInfo":
    {
      "header": "Notification of disruption",
      "text": "Network errors are causing some identifications to fail"
    }
}
```

Service Provider needs to use and display these fields: `isbProviderInfo`, `isbConsent`, `privacyNoticeText` and `privacyNoticeLink` on the UI.
The `privacyNoticeLink` is a hyperlink to the OP's privacy notice page and the `privacyNoticeText` is the link text.  `DisturbanceInfo` is an optional field, which is only included in case a disturbance notification has been published. It gives information about identified disturbancies in the ISB service or in the Identity Providers. It is highly recommended to show this data to end users on the embedded Identity Service Broker UI. Both the `header` and the `text` are localised according to `lang` query parameter.

API errors:

| Error | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 404 Not found | the given client_id is not valid | error is shown on ISB |

## 7. GET/POST /oauth/authorize

To initiate the identification process the service provider directs the user to OP's OIDC endpoint either by redirect or by direct link. The request parameters are passed to the ISB in a signed JWS token. The token is sent in the GET request's query string as `request` parameter or in the POST request in `payload` as a JSON having structure `{request: <JWS_TOKEN>}`. The following parameters are supported in the authorization request as JWS token claims:

- **client_id** is the client identifier that specifies which service provider is asking for identification.
- **redirect_uri** specifies to which URI on your site (the service provider) you want the user to return to once identification is done.
Please note! In the production environment this URI must be registered beforehand with OP with the technical form to prevent other services misusing your credentials. In case the given redirect_uri parameter does not match the registered URI the /oauth/authorize endpoint returns an error and identification is finished. Redirect_uri must be using secure http schema.
- **response_type** value must be `code`.
- **scope** is a space separated list of scopes, or  basically sets of information requested. This must include `openid` and `personal_identity_code` and can optionally include also `profile`, `weak` and `strong`. Other scope values are rejected. For example `openid profile personal_identity_code` is accectable. The `profile` includes `name`, `given_name`, `family_name` and `birthdate`. If the Service Provider's purpose for identifying the user is to create new identification methods, i.e. for example to create an user account with username and password, then the Service Provider must report such purpose by adding either `weak` (for weak identifiers, for example password account) or `strong` (for strong electronic identification which is only for the officially licensed members of the Finnish Trust Network) to the scopes. Using weak or strong as a purpose may affect pricing and depends on your contract.

The following optional parameters (JWS token claims) may be used:
- **ui_locales** selects user interface language (`fi`, `sv` or `en`).
- **nonce** value is passed on to identity token as is. Use of `nonce` is highly recommended. It MUST contain at least 128 bits of entropy (for example at least 22 random characters AZ, a-z, 0-9). SP should make sure that the `nonce` attribute in the ID Token matches the value of sent `nonce`.
- **prompt** can be set to `consent` to indicate that the user should be asked to consent to personal data being transferred. In this case the Identity Service Broker will display a verification screen after the user has been authenticated.
- **state** is an opaque value you can use to maintain state between request and callback. Use of `state` is recommended. SP should make sure that the state-parameter it sends matches the state-parameter is receives in response to the redirect_uri.
- **ftn_idp_id** shall be delivered if the SP has the embedded Identity Service Broker UI. Parameter contains the id of the user chosen idp.
- **exp** the expiration time of the JWS token. This is seconds since UNIX epoch (UTC). Suggested time is 600 seconds in the future. If given, ISB checks that the JWS has not expired. If it has expired the ISB will respond with an error.
- **jti** JWT ID. A unique identifier for JWS tokens, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These identifiers must only be used once. If given, ISB checks if this `jti` has already been used and if it has ISB will respond with an error.
- **iss** Issuer. This must contain the client_id. If `jti` is given, this must be given as well.

The JWS token must be signed with the RS256 algorithm with SP's signing key.

Example identification request:

`GET https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/authorize?request=eyJhb[...]`
`POST https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/authorize with payload set as {request=eyJhb[...]}`

Once the identification process is done or if there is a recoverable error, the user is directed back to the service provider to the URI specified in the request. The following parameters are included in the query string:
- **state** is passed as is from the request.
- **code** is the authorization code for use in the next phase (only included after succesful identification).
- **error** is the reason why identification failed (in case of error only).

Example return:

`GET https://example-service-provider.example/bell?code=eyJhb[...]4bGg&state=GIlBncQk4vsbThjMNBJ49G` using Hapi / Bell library on javascript

`GET http://example-service-provider/?code=eyJh[....]_0w&state=77deb5b7f773ef6dafc12d9cf0588f57` using league/oauth2-client library on PHP

API errors:

| Error | Description | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| invalid_request | request parameter validation fails | redirected to the SP with error and error description|
| invalid_scope | openid or personal_identity_code scope is missing. Validation fails | redirected to the SP with error and error description|
| access_denied | e.g. validation error | redirected to the SP with error and error description|
| cancel | user cancel | redirected to the SP with error and error description|
| various validation errors | initial validation errors e.g. on invalid client_id, invalid or unsigned JWT etc.| error and error description are shown on ISB without return link back to SP |
| various errors during identification | OIDC, Saml2 or Tupas identification might go wrong for a number of reasons | error and error description are shown on ISB with return link back to SP |

In case the SP gets error code "cancel" with error description "user cancel" it means that the end user has canceled identification when the ISB hosted UI is being used. If the SP gets this error when using it's own embedded Identity Service Broker UI, it means that the end user has canceled identification on one of the Identity Providers, but might want to continue identification with another Identity Provider. In this case the SP should just simply display it's own embedded Identity Service Broker UI again.

## 8. POST /oauth/token

The actual user identity token from the token endpoint can be fetched using the /oauth/token API. The following parameters shall be included as request payload parameters:
- **code** authorization code, which was returned in succesful /oauth/authorize/ reply. Mandatory.
- **grant_type** needs to have value `authorization_code`. Mandatory.
- **client_assertion_type** must be `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer`.
- **client_assertion** is a signed JWS authentication token. The JWS must be signed with the RS256 algorithm with SP's signing key.

Please make sure that you have header set to allow JSON response, and data in the POST request must be application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    headers=dict(
        Accept='application/json'
    )

The client_assertion is signed using the SP's signing key and must contain the following claims:
- **iss** Issuer. This must contain the client_id.
- **sub** Subject. This must contain the client_id.
- **aud** Audience. The aud (audience) Claim. This must match the ISB's token endpoint URL.
- **jti** JWT ID. A unique identifier for JWS tokens, which can be used to prevent reuse of the token. These identifiers must only be used once. ISB checks if this `jti` has already been used and if it has ISB will respond with an error.
- **exp** Expiration time for the token. This is seconds since UNIX epoch (UTC). Suggested time is 600 seconds in the future. ISB checks that the JWS has not expired. If it has expired the ISB will respond with an error.

Example identification request:

`POST https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/token`

client_assertion is a JWS token and it might look like this (captured using the PHP based demo service provider example __See section 14__):
```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzYWlwcHVha2F1cHBpYXMiLCJzdWIiOiJzYWlwcHVha2F1cHBpYXMiLCJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2lzYi10ZXN0Lm9wLmZpL29hdXRoL3Rva2VuIiwianRpIjoiNThkMWQ4ODk3OGIwYTY4MDliODg1NSIsImV4cCI6MTU2MjA3NjY1N30.GiIviTLsdTkrEfFNXnCQZnlJOMBss1bcxp_fOIJx9rrlLo3QHlW1KLIPv4RCusH7CVqiRyGaXMz5V0-eFBPMrOLU68N1GxRIaJErZCUyU1uasP-qdEANJExwbrvOJ4Xt0wT51BVVdNwUgchkbjKY62wjj-ywHogpID2tI6vLS98uoWBq09sb_aZL9bLFLvNh85IJzAfOH748bxSByEtL0_-xTmYJBe4D_5Z5YDunkSjl4-SDts0ETl-0jdOPm8-ps2LdcFoGnwbNU_6Wp4JCggUqOP4F8JS-M1U0GeqEMvVLpURjQOAt06H-I-ppmnhAfibSeslmTw4FiTfVVaSHDA
```

The following is a snapshot of the payload inside the JWS token captured using the PHP based demo service provider example __See section 14__  :
```json
{
  "iss": "saippuakauppias",
  "sub": "saippuakauppias",
  "aud": "https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/token",
  "jti": "58d1d88978b0a6809b8855",
  "exp": 1562076657
}
```

The API returns json data.

Example of returned data:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJh[...]2A",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "id_token": "eyJl[...]Nw"
}
```

API errors:

| Error code | Error | Error description | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 400 Bad Request | unauthorized_client | invalid assertion | client_assertion or client_assertion_type are invalid |
| 400 Bad Request | invalid_request | client information fetching failed | client_id in request is unknown |
| 400 Bad Request | invalid_request | parameter validation failed | required request parameters missing or contains incorrect information |
| 400 Bad Request | invalid_request | invalid grant | e.g. authorization code already exchanged |


The error and error description are returned to SP as json together with error code.
```json
{
  "error":"unauthorized_client",
  "error_description":"invalid%20assertion"
}
```

Parameter explanations:
- **access_token** Access Token for the /oauth/profile API (OIDC UserInfo Endpoint)
- **token_type** OAuth 2.0 Token Type value. The value is always `Bearer`
- **expires_in** Expiration time of the Access Token in seconds since the response was generated
- **id_token** Identity Token

## 9. Identity token

The identity token is a JWT token that contains identity attributes about the user, for example name, date of birth or personal identity code. The token is signed by OP's RSA key. The signed token is embedded and encrypted into an JWE token using the service provider's public key.

To obtain the user attributes from the identity token you need to first decrypt the JWE token (`id_token`) received from the '/oauth/token' API. Decryption is done using the Service Provider private RSA key. The decrypted JWS token is signed using OP's RSA certificate to prevent tampering. Service Provider needs to verify that the signature is valid using the JWT library of your choice and the OP's public RSA key. The payload of the JWS token embedded in the JWE token contains user information.

The information received depends on the scope of identification request and on what attributes are available. Do note that not all sources of information have given name and family name available as separate attributes. The following attributes may be available currently:

- **birthdate**: Birth date
- **given_name**: Given name
- **family_name**: Family name
- **name**: Family name and given name
- **personal_identity_code**: The Finnish personal identity code

In addition there are these standard attributes:

- **iss**: Issuer. This should be the same as `issuer` key in .well-known/openid-configuration metadata. __See section 11__. SP can compare this value to the key value from metadata.
- **sub**: Subject identifier, not persistent, feel free to ignore
- **aud**: Audience this ID Token is intended for. It MUST contain the SP `client_id`
- **exp**: Expiration time in seconds since UNIX epoch on or after which the ID Token MUST NOT be accepted for processing.
- **iat**: Time at which the JWT was issued in seconds since UNIX epoch
- **auth_time**: Time of authentication in seconds since UNIX epoch
- **nonce**: Case sensitive string from the authentication request to associate an end-user with an ID token and to mitigate replay attacks. SP MUST verify that the `nonce` attribute value is equal to the value of the `nonce` parameter sent in the authentication request. In case there was no `nonce` parameter sent in the authentication request, this attribute is not used.
- **acr**:  The Authentication Context Class Reference string for this authentication transaction

Example:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://isb-test.op.fi",
  "sub": "59cc74ea-40d7-4000-85c6-e5f7c2e14205",
  "aud": "saippuakauppias",
  "exp": 1562076657,
  "iat": 1562076057,
  "acr": "http://ftn.ficora.fi/2017/loatest2",
  "nonce": "ab960b7480a00047fb0d23",
  "name": "von Möttonen Matti Matias",
  "given_name": "Matti Matias",
  "family_name": "von Möttonen",
  "birthdate": "1900-01-01",
  "personal_identity_code": "010100-969P",
  "auth_time": 1562076057
}
```

## 10. GET /oauth/profile

This API is the OIDC UserInfo Endpoint. There is no need to call this if Service Provider has already got all the needed user information in processing the reply from the /oauth/token.
Service Provider can send request to the OIDC UserInfo Endpoint to obtain Claims about the End-User using an Access Token obtained from the /oauth/token API reply. The UserInfo Endpoint is an OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] Protected Resource that complies with the OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage [RFC6750] specification. The Access Token shall be sent using the Authorization header field as described below:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJh[...]2A
```

where `eyJh[...]2A` is the access_token.

Example identification request:

`GET https://isb-test.op.fi/oauth/profile`

API errors:

in case of error the ISB returns error code back to the SP with www-authenticate header. This header contains the error details as follows.

| Error code | www-authenticate header contents | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 Unauthorized | bearer | authorization header missing from request or invalid |
| 401 Unauthorized | bearer, error="invalid_token" | e.g. authorization token is invalid |
| 400 Bad Request | error="invalid_request",error_description="invalid_client" | Unknown client_id in profile request |


The API returns json data in succesful scenario. The information received depends on the scope of identification request and on what attributes are available. Do note that not all sources of information have given name and family name available as separate attributes. The following attributes may be available currently:

- **birthdate**: Birth date
- **given_name**: Given name
- **family_name**: Family name
- **name**: Family name and given name
- **personal_identity_code**: The Finnish personal identity code

In addition there is this standard attribute:

- **sub**: Subject identifier, not persistent, feel free to ignore

Example of returned data:
```json
{
  "sub": "1",
  "name": "von Möttonen Matti Matias",
  "personal_identity_code": "010101-011"
}
```

## 11. GET /.well-known/openid-configuration

We provide an optional OpenID Discovery metadata endpoint. It may be used to configure OAuth2 client implementations should they require it. The endpoint for production use is `https://isb.op.fi/.well-known/openid-configuration`. For testing please use the sandbox endpoint `https://isb-test.op.fi/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

## 12. JWKS

The JWKS endpoints are used to exchange public keys between parties. Both SP and ISB have a JWKS endpoint to publish their own public keys. The SP's JWKS endpoint URL has to be registered with OP in the production environment.

In the Sandbox there is no need to implement JWKS endpoint in the SP end as the ISB uses provided keys, but SP must fetch the ISB signing key from the ISB's JWKS endpoint.

SP needs to publish two types of public keys in it's JWKS endpoint:
- key for verifying both the signed /oauth/authorize request JWS token and the signed JWS token in client_assertion field in the /oauth/token request.
- key for identity token encrypting

ISB publishes one type of public key in it's JWKS endpoint:
- key for verifying the signed identity token

The ISB's JWKS endpoint is publicly available. Note that around the time of key rotation there are multiple sig-keys (both old and new) published at the same time.

For example in Sandbox: `GET https://isb-test.op.fi/jwks/broker`.

Example response:

```json

Note that the kid's listed in the JWKS endpoint must match to the kid's you specify in the JWS tokens. When using the sandbox environment, be careful to use the kid's mentioned in the above example and not one's you generate yourself. Because the sandbox environment uses predefined keys the ISB does not call your JWKS endpoint. If you wish to test your JWKS endpoint, you can do it by comparing your output against the contents of `sp-sample-jwks.json` in this repository.

About ISB key rotation.

ISB rotates the signing key once a week in production. To help testing, the signing key is rotated daily in the Sandbox environment. The figure below illustrates the lifecycle of the keys.

![Key rotation](./key_rotation.png?raw=true)

- CREATE, new key is created
- WARM-UP, key is published in the JWKS but not in use
- NORMAL USE, key is in use
- COOLDOWN, key is still published in the JWKS and is not in use
- TAIL, key is not published anymore in the JWKS, key is not in use
- DELETION, key is deleted

Caching the keys fetched from the JWKS endpoint is a good idea, but make sure that the refresh mechanism supports the ISB lifecycle, and there is a forced cache refresh in case key is not found.

## 13. Public Sandbox for customer testing

The public Sandbox differs from the production in three major ways.

- The Sandbox environment provides test data instead of real personal information.
- To use the Sandbox environment you need to use the separate API endpoints described above.
- Common shared credentials and client id are used for the Sandbox environment. Because the sandbox does not require registration all developers need to use the provided keys (instead of their own keys).
- SP do not need to implement JWKS-endpoint as the ISB uses provided keys.
- redirect_uri does not have to agreed with OP in Sandbox.
- the /api/embedded-ui/{client_id} endpoint always returns disturbanceInfo field in the returned Json data. It either contains real disturbance information of the Sandbox or contains a placeholder text: "This is a placeholder for disturbance information to help implementation". This is to help implementation of the UI.

These id's and keys are used for the Sandbox environment:

- **Client identifier**: saippuakauppias
- **Token encryption / decryption key**: See `sandbox-sp-encryption-key.pem`
- **Signing key**: See `sandbox-sp-signing-key.pem`

## 14. Service Provider code examples

OP Provides the following Service Provider demo applications:

- PHP-based: https://github.com/op-developer/Identity-Service-Broker-integration-example
- Java-based: https://github.com/op-developer/Identity-Service-Broker-integration-java-example
- Python-based: https://github.com/op-developer/Identity-Service-Broker-integration-python-example
- Typescript-based: https://github.com/op-developer/Identity-Service-Broker-integration-typescript-example

## 15. Libraries for Service Provider

See the examples directory for examples on how to implement a service provider based on various libraries and languages.

## 16. Javascript

Node-jose can be used to decrypt and verify the identity token. See https://github.com/cisco/node-jose .

Broadly speaking we do not currently advise use of generic OpenID Connect libraries. They often lack support for signed authorization requests and encrypted ID tokens, requiring you to extend them for use with our API. In such situations it is typically easier to implement your service provider with libraries offering slightly lower level of abstraction, as demonstrated by our code examples.

## 17. PHP

oauth2-client makes it simple to integrate your Service Provider application with OP ISB OpenID Connect flow. See https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client .

Jose-php can be used to decrypt and verify the identity token. See https://github.com/nov/jose-php .

## 18. Java

Nimbus JOSE+JWT is a Java library for Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). See https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.nimbusds/nimbus-jose-jwt . This library is used in the Java based integration example. __See section 14__

## 19. Python

JWCrypto is an Python library implementation of the Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) Web Standards as they are being developed in the JOSE IETF Working Group and related technology. See https://github.com/latchset/jwcrypto
